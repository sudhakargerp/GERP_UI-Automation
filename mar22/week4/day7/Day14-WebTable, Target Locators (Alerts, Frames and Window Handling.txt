	b) Web based popup
	
		i) Modal dialog:
		=================
			Within the webpage dialog box appears and it is part of the HTML page - webelement
					
			Properties:
			We cannot inspect (unable to view inspect on right click)
			We cannot interact with the main page until you handle the alert message
			Alerts are written in JavaScript (not HTML)
			
			1) Simple Alert - 
				OK button - accept();
				Get the Text value - getText();
			2) Confirmation Alert - 
				Ok - accept(); 
				cancel - dismiss();
				Get the Text value - getText()
			3. Prompt Alert
				Ok - accept(); 
				cancel - dismiss();
				Get the Text value - getText()
